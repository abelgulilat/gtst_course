### Function
- A block of code that perform a specific task.
1. Standard library Function (built in function) all key word
2. User-Defined functions-(we can create our own function)
3. DRY(Do not repeat Yourself)
### Recursion
- A function call itself.
- Advantages of Recursion -- Recursive functions make the code look clean and elegant.
					------A complex task can be broken down into simpler sub-problems using recursion.
					---Sequence generation is easier with recursion than using some nested iteration.
### Lambda/ Anonymous
	- lambda  argument : expression   example :- mul = lambda num1,num2 : num1*num2
### Function takers function
- Filter, map, Reduce take function as argument.
- filter are used to filter or search from Sequence.   list(filter(even_function, list_item))
- map are used to do some operation on sequences.   list(map(double_function, list_item))
List.append("Ball")

### Object-Oriented Programing / OOP
- a place where we create our object attribute and behaviour .
- a blueprint for that object.
- **Object** which have action and name.
- **Object** have property and method.
### Creating Methods
- function are called method on OOP.
- **Constractor**
- **Inheritance**
- **Encapsulation**
### Package Installation
