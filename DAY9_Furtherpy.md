### Function
- A block of code that perform a specific task.
1. Standard library Function (built in function) all key word
2. User-Defined functions-(we can create our own function)
### Recursion
- A function call itself.
- Advantages of Recursion -- Recursive functions make the code look clean and elegant.
					------A complex task can be broken down into simpler sub-problems using recursion.
					---Sequence generation is easier with recursion than using some nested iteration.
