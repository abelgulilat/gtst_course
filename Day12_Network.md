-  Network is two or more entities sharing resource and information.
- network become a powerful tool when share resource with same network or distinct network.
- computer on network can act client(send request for resource) or a server(control and provide access to resources but have higher RAM, CPU, STORAGE).
### Need of Network
- enhance communication ,share resources, centralized management, Internet.
#### Classification of Networks
- Classification by Geography. Based on geographical boundaries span by network itself. (LAN, WAN, MAN) 
- Classification by Component roles. Based on networked computer play in the network operation. (peer-to-peer, server-based, client-based).
#### IP(Internet Protocol) address
- Network Layer Protocol (identify machine on a network, allow transfer of file).
- a device connect to network uses internet protocol.
- IP4(32-bit)192.1.2..3 --dot decimal format---generate by DHCP or Manually, (0-255)
- IP6(128-bit)  .
- when machine connect to network generate ip and given.
- every ip address has Network(identify network), HOST(identify the user) parts.
- **public ip** (used in WAN network) ,**private ip** (used in LAN network).
- NAT(Network Address Translation).

#### Five class of private ip4
- class A(host 24bit) --(0-127 bit)
- B(host 16bit) ---- (128-191bit)
- C(host 8bit) ------(192-223bit)
- D E
#### Reserved IPV4 Address--- 
- cannot be assigned to device on a network.
1. address for beginning 127 reserved for loop back and internal testing.
2. 0's for all hosting bit reserved for network address.
3. 1 or 255 for all hosting bit position is reserved for broadcast address
#### IPv6
- it is alphanumberic. identify an end point device.
- automatically generated.
