## Programming Language
- language is used to communicate with computer.(Assembly, C, C++, Javascript, python, Ruby, Perl, Go)
- program write in programming Language.
- programming is *algorithm* express in programming language.
- algorithm is a detail sequence of action to perform some specific task. and named after Iranian mathematician, **Al-Khwarizmi**.
## Evolution of I/O
- *punch cards* with all the data and execute together with other program the same libraries output *line printer*.(Punched Card was Invented by ****Joseph Marie Jacquard**** in 1801.)
- *interactive processing* which allow the user to provide data while the program was running.
- modern computers and devices where users can interact with the system in real-time. Punch card computers did not offer this level of interactivity.
## Generation of Computers
1. First Generation: Vacuum Tube(memory, CPU) ===> input to computer is punch cards, output is print out (1940-1956) the instruction written in machine language(0's, 1's), large in size.

2. Second Generation: (1956-1963)==tansistor== replace vacuum tube == it reduce size of computer and increase efficiency
- magnetic core as primary memory, 
- magnetic tape and magnetic disk seconder memory
- **the instruction stored in memory written in assembly language
	- (COBOL and FORTRAN )high level language
- (still use punch card and print out)

3. Third Generation:(1965-1971) IC, it reduce size of computer
	- keyboard and monitor use instead of punched card and print out
	- used remote processing, Time-Sharing, Real-time, Multi-programming OS, high level language
	- computation time is nanosecond
	- limitation on the storage
4. Fourth Generation:(1971-present) LSI and VLSI(Microprocessor)
	- semi conductor memory replace magnetic core memory (it become faster to access)
	- secondary storage become smaller in size
	- the linking/networking of computer which eventually led to development of Internet Usage
	- MS-DOS, MS-Window
	- and support GUI
	- Apple introduce Macintosh computer

5. Fifth Generation: ULSI 
	- focused on *thinking computer* that is *Artificial Intelligence* (AI)
	- parallel processing hardware and AI software(Expert System, Natural Language Processing, Speech recognition, Voice recognition, Robotics)
	- high level language (C, C++, JAVA, .NET)
	- ROBOT , APPLICATION, this generation computer ex(intel dual core microprocessor)
